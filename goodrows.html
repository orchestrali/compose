    <h1>Finding Good Rows</h1>

    <h3>3-bell...runs?</h3>
    <p>Three bells don't make much of a run, particularly on more than six bells total. But if a row has two or more three-bell runs, it's probably a nice row! A common goal of call changes on ten is 3216549870, which could be described as three three-bell runs.</p>
